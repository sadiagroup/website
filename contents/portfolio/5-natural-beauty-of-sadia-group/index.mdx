title: Natural Beauty of Sadia Group
description: Sadia Group believes in being one with nature. In our vast project at Mirzapur, Tangail, we have an abundance of natural elements. There are over thousands of varieties of trees and plants. The fruits and vegetables gardens are maintained all around the year. There are also four ponds filled with fishes and surrounded by ducks. The livestock include cows, oxen, buffalos, goats, sheep, pigeons, chickens, and whatnot.
