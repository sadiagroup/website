[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d69d3e64-54ba-49d2-8b8a-10054b7b3c4a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sadiagroup/deploys)

## Getting Started.

To run locally, you will need Node.js and Yarn. If you already have Node.js installed, run `npm i -g yarn` to install Yarn.

Start the project by `yarn dev`. This will start the development server and serve the development bundle.

To view the production bundle, run `yarn build` to build it.

## Troubleshooting

If something is not working properly, restart the development server. If the problem still shows up, run `yarn clean` and start the server again. If the problem persists after this, remove the `node_modules` directory, run `yarn`, then start the development server.

If these steps do not solve the problem, please open an issue on GitHub, stating your problem clearly.
