## 🧑🏽‍💻 Technology Stack

- React.js
- Gatsby.js
- TypeScript
- Yarn

## 🏁 Getting Started

To run locally, you will need Node.js and Yarn. If you already have Node.js installed, run `npm i -g yarn` to install Yarn.

Start the project by `yarn dev`. This will start the development server and serve the development bundle.

To view the production bundle, run `yarn build` to build it.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If something is not working properly, restart the development server. If the problem still shows up, run `yarn clean` and start the server again. If the problem persists after this, remove the `node_modules` directory, run `yarn`, then start the development server.

If these steps do not solve the problem, please open an issue on GitHub, stating your problem clearly.
